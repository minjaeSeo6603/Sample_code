`Python`: Python work

`Stata`: Stata work

`R`: Programming Work

## Overview
This repository contains code samples and work from various research projects I've undertaken, using Python, Stata, and R. It includes:

`Dissertation`: This folder houses my ongoing work on my senior thesis, where I am analyzing the impact of the Affordable Care Act on enrollment rates for underserved populations. I am currently refining this work under the guidance of my professor.

`Python`: A collection of Python code used for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling in different research projects, including econometrics and social science studies.

`Stata`: Stata code utilized for econometric analysis, including difference-in-differences models and regression discontinuity designs, applied to various public policy issues.

`R`: R code for the causal analysis of urban/regional economics using `GGPLOT`, `DPLYR`, `ivreg`, etc.

Each folder includes the sample code and work produced using the respective programming languages. 
The repository serves as a demonstration of my ability to manage and analyze large datasets and conduct statistical analyses in Python, Stata, and R.
